#Standardizing the input feature
#StandardScaler standardizes a feature by subtracting the mean and then scaling to unit variance.
#It will transform your data such that its distribution will have a mean value 0 and standard deviation of 1.
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
sc = StandardScaler()
X = sc.fit_transform(X)


Deploy models using OOP (object oriented programming) - use classes instead of function, etc.
