#Standardizing the input feature
#StandardScaler standardizes a feature by subtracting the mean and then scaling to unit variance.
#It will transform your data such that its distribution will have a mean value 0 and standard deviation of 1.
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
sc = StandardScaler()
X = sc.fit_transform(X)


Deploy models using OOP (object oriented programming) - use classes instead of function, etc.

Neural Networks Learning Steps: (Image)
layer 1: (Pixel to Edges) (input & hidden layer 1)
layer 2: edges to pattern (hidden layer 1 & hidden layer 2)
final_layer: pattern to image recognition
