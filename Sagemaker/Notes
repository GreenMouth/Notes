# Model Training: XGBOOST Sagemaker Requiremetns
# No header row
# Outcome variable in the first column, features in the rest of the columns 
# All columns need to be numeric


# 70% train, 15% validation, 15% test
print(df_train.shape) #these samples are used to train the model
print(df_valid.shape) #these samples are held out from the training data and are used to make decisions on how to improve the model
print(df_test.shape) #these samples are held out from all decisions and are used to measure the generalized performance of the model


# After training, we can use the estimator to create an Amazon SageMaker endpoint 
# Amazon SageMaker endpoint is a hosted and managed prediction service that we can use to perform inference.
# Deploy the model on a server and create an endpoint that you can access
# After the model is trained, this step deploys our model to Amazon SageMaker hosting. 
# It takes a few minutes to set up the hosting endpoin -- Takes ~5 minutes

# Delete the Endpoint
# If you're done with this exercise, please run the delete_endpoint line in the cell below. 
# This will remove the hosted endpoint and avoid any charges from a stray instance being left on.
# Tear down the SageMaker endpoint
