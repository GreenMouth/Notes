# Model Training: XGBOOST Sagemaker Requiremetns
# No header row
# Outcome variable in the first column, features in the rest of the columns 
# All columns need to be numeric


# 70% train, 15% validation, 15% test
print(df_train.shape) #these samples are used to train the model
print(df_valid.shape) #these samples are held out from the training data and are used to make decisions on how to improve the model
print(df_test.shape) #these samples are held out from all decisions and are used to measure the generalized performance of the model
