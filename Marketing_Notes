Incrementality Measure: (e.g. Direct Mail)
There are many techniques from data science like Bayesian statistical modelling or hidden Markov models that 
can be used in order to model a user’s journey and predict how a user would behave if the journey was to slightly change.

Since human nature is unpredictable, even when trying to control for every variable, there will always be some level of unpredictability.
If you are running media outside your test with other programmatic vendors, digital channel partners (social, search), 
or traditional offline partners (TV, billboards, radio, print), how are you ensuring the control group is not exposed 
to your brand through these other marketing efforts? 
The point of a control group is to be unbiased. If your control group is exposed to other media in uneven or unknown ways, 
you risk data contamination.
The expectation that advertisers will turn off all other media for a test is unrealistic, but it should play into interpreting results.

Control group should be same in testing incrementality.
In a strict incremental lift test, your control audience should be identical to your exposed audience, 
but to inflate lift, some vendors may target an inferior control group.

Statistical significance are measured through ‘confidence levels’.
Confidence levels are the minimum threshold at which results cannot be due to random chance, and that if repeated, would return similar results.
