# OSx_vs_Windows
Which OS is better for doing DS, ML &amp; AI work?

Even if the Data Science & Machine learning work is independent of Operating System; below are some of my personal reasons why I prefer using OSx over Windows OS:

Three primary reasons for using Mac for doing Data Science / Machine Learning work:

1) 
Data Science/Machine Learning work requires high usage of terminal (mac) / command prompt (windows).
For Windows OS, you need to install PuTTY or something similar to ssh; while Mac and Linux machines run it natively in their terminals. 

2)
Mac is a Unix based system & makes a lot of things easier in terms for ML work.
ML open source tools are better supported in OSx and Linux, and much easier to install. (e.g. Using Python ML libraries on Windows means waiting for libraries to be compiled as binaries)
Since a lot of Machine Learning & Deep Learning packages are built on top of UNIX, they'll have better compatibility in OSx.
In Windows, a lot of pre-requisites required for packages to be installed & use. (e.g. Using Python, R, git commands are all one-liners in OSx compared with Windows)

3) 
Personally, I am comfortable with OSx. 
Nearly everyone I know in the data science world uses a Mac. 
Also, Mac User Experience is better than Windows
And keyboard is different.
