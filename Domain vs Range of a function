X- Axis: Domain
Y-Axis: Range

The 'domain' is the time between sunrise and sunset, 
whereas the 'range' is the axis from 0 to the maximum elevation the sun will have on a particular day on a particular latitude.

Domain is also defined as a set of all probable input values. 
This means that the output value will depend on each member. 
On the other hand, range is defined as a set of all probable output values.

Domain is what is put into a function, whereas range is what is the result of the function with the domain value.
